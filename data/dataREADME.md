# About the Data

Let's talk a bit about the data for this tutorial. The AI models that we build with U-nets will predominantly involve public data from the [CHAOS dataset](https://chaos.grand-challenge.org/Data/). This is the Combined Health Abdominal Organ Segmentation Grand Challenge.

After working through our guided tutorial with the CHAOS dataset, we also recommend registering to access the [LiTS - Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094). This dataset has tumor segmentations in addition to liver segmentations and is a great opportunity to further explore and reinforce the concepts covered in our guided tutorial for working with the CHAOS dataset.

Additionally, this repository contains selected de-identified DICOM files which are independent of the CHAOS and LiTS datasets which we use in the tutorial lessons as examples for working with different variants of DICOM files.
