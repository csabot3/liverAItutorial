# Liver AI Tutorial
This is a tutorial for working with radiology data and AI models of the liver which is designed to be run via Google Colab - currently under construction

## Lesson 1: Data Basics

Basics of working with DICOMs in Python.

## Lesson 2: Liver Segmentation

U-net segmentation of the liver on CT and MRI using the CHAOS dataset and FastAI. Divided into 2 parts to separately cover CT and MRI segmentation.

## Lesson 2, Part 1: Liver Segmentation on CT

U-net segmentation of the liver on CT data using FastAI and the CHAOS dataset.

## Lesson 2, Part 2: Liver Segmentation on MRI

U-net segmentation of the liver on MRI data using FastAI and the CHAOS dataset. Covers scenarios involving only segmenting the liver and scenarios with multi-organ segmentation.

## Lesson 3: Radiomics Basics

Exploration of utility of organ segmentations for further data analysis. We highlight the SimpleITK and Pyradiomics packages for further analysis of radiology segmentation data.
